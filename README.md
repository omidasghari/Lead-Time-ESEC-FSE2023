Lead Time Analysis for UAVs Failure Prediction in U-space

This Repository contains several files illustrated as follows:

1) Complete_Faults.zip: In this folder, the fault injection tool generates 18 types of fault/failure files and will apply to the Fault injection Environment.
2) Faulty Run and Gold Run folders is a sample data of Gold run and Faulty Run for Invalid Fixed Value and mission number 6 that can be analyzed with Matlab.
3) Missions folder: All 28 mission plans are available in this folder. 
4) PX4 source code: This folder consists of the C++ source code of the PX4, which fault and failure were injected by this source code. 
5) Lead Time Analysis Source Code file: This file contains Matlab source code for analyzing the Gold Run and Faulty Run Data and calculating the Lead Time and python source code for analyzing and displaying the results.
